### Run project locally from IDE

To run the project locally, you need to include the opencv module,
containing the native library. For that, include the module path
as a JVM argument. Example:

```
--module-path /home/raffa/IdeaProjects/profilometer/build/distributions/profilometer-1.0-SNAPSHOT/lib
--module com.profilometer/com.profilometer.ProfilometerApplication
```
